# Sticker designs

This repository includes stickers what I have previously designed.

All the stickers use fonts that I have access and the fonts allow the sticker designs to be released under the **Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International** ([CC-BY-NC-4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/)) license.

## Ordering stickers

I recommend ordering from [StickerApp](https://stickerapp.com/). The website has amazing web GUI for customizing the sticker print to your own needs.

If you are ordering these stickers, please let me know and give few sitckers for me as well ðŸ˜Ž

## License information

The idea of the **CC-BY-NC-4.0** license is to allow people, organizations and companies to order these stickers themselves **without** changing the sticker design to their organization's brand. You are allowed to adapt (and hopefully) improve the design in other ways.
